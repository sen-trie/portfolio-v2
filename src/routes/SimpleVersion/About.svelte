		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a self-taught frontend web developer focused on building clean, functional interfaces. I
			enjoy learning through projects and consistently push myself to pick up new frameworks,
			programming languages, and development methods as I work.
			<br /><br />
			Alongside my dev work, I'm also a self-taught 3D animator, specializing in character animation.
			What started with a few tutorials turned into a love for storytelling through movement. It's a process
			that has taught me to be patient and to focus on the tiny details that make a story feel alive and
			believable.
			<br /><br />
			Personally, I'm at my best when I can mix the creative side of my brain with the technical side.
			Most of my work is about taking a creative vision and building the systems needed to make it a reality,
			keeping things simple and reliable along the way.
